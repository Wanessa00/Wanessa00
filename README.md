## Hello! I’m Wanessa

🔬 Biomedical Scientist | 💻 Bioinformatician in Training  
📚 Currently pursuing a postgraduate degree in Molecular Biology  
🧠 Focused on mental health research  

🧬 About Me

Human curiosity has always intrigued me—our innate drive to ask “why?” and seek deeper understanding. It’s something we see clearly in children, whose endless questions open new ways of seeing the world. In my work as a post-graduate student in Molecular Biology, I apply this curiosity to studying the human brain, particularly in relation to mental health conditions such as Major Depressive Disorder, Schizophrenia, and Bipolar Disorder. 

💡 What I’m Currently Working On
- Single-nucleus sequencing 🧬 of post-mortem brain samples to explore gene expression patterns related to psychiatric disorders.
- Developing bioinformatics pipelines using R and Bash to process and analyze genomic data.
- Understanding the molecular basis of mental health disorders, with a focus on depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.

⚙️ Skills and Tools
- **Languages**: R, Bash  
- **Bioinformatics**: Single-cell RNA-seq, Nucleus RNA-seq, Data pre-processing and QC  
- **Research Interests**: Psychiatric disorders (Depression, Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder)  
- **Analysis**: Differential gene expression, Clustering, Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE)  
- **Visualization**: ggplot2, ComplexHeatmap (R)
